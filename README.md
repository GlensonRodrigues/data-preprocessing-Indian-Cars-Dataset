The Indian automobile market is one of the largest in the world, both in terms of sales volume and production. Talking about historical roots of the car market in India, the first time that a vehicle came on road was in 1897. Till 1930, India did not have any manufacturing facility and cars were imported directly from other countries. The landmark decade in the manufacturing process was that of 1940s, in which Indian companies like Hindustan Motors and Premier started to manufacture cars of other firms. During the same decade, Mahindra & Mahindra also started to produce utility vehicles.

The car market in India has evolved by leaps and bounds as almost all major companies are present in the country. India has now become a hub for auto makers to set up their plants for manufacturing vehicles intended for domestic and international markets.
